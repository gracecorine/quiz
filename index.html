                Before started, i need to make this clear first. This is just my opinion. I'm no psychologist. So, i can't do much either.But, if this can help you even a little bit. I would be happy :).</p>
            A lot people nowadays is easier to get stressed even with a small things. Due to the chaos that happened to our world. No one really know the reason why, but what we know is we have to survive from this pandemic. That's not an easy word, i know. However,
            life must go on. Maybe we lost a lot of things. Everyone is on their last stage from keeping their consciousness. Like a time bomb. This is a really sensitive issues.

            <p>Maybe this is not a really wayout for some people. But here is what i think of what we can do to prevent that 'time bomb' If you need someone to hear your story, i can help you. But, i can't say that i could give you a wayout. Because i'm
                just a mere human. Btw, I'll put the link below just in case you need me :)</p>

            <h3>Exercise</h3> <img id="sport" src="https://cdn.dribbble.com/users/959848/screenshots/2340437/dr-atl.gif">
            <p>I used to exercise for some times. And maybe because i did it with my friend, it was pretty fun. And i mean, we did it online. Haha. Just by a video call, and one of you just need to watch a video with some exercise video. </p>
            <h3>Listen to soothing music</h3>
            <p>I really love to hear a song, and sing. Because for me it's something that can really release my stress. I mean like sometimes i can sing really loud. Which is not so good for my neighborhoods. Sorry. :(</p>
            <h3>Sleep Better</h3>
            <p>Since it is have a very good impact for us. It is a must. But, not everrthing goes by what we want it to be. I also can't sleep so well. But if you can, that will boost your mood. At least, for me. Maybe you use breathing techniques 4-7-8
                to overcome insomnia. Take a deep breath for 4 seconds, then hold your breath for 7 seconds, then exhale your breath for 8 seconds. For few times. </p>
            <h3>Watch some movies</h3> <img id="music" src="https://media.tenor.com/images/c7463075c551b137548f34f15ec656a3/tenor.gif">
